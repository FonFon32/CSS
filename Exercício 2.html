        Although each of the world's countries

  
        would like to dispute this fact,
        
          
        we French know the truth:
        
          
        The best food in the world
        is made in France.
        
          
        The best food in France
        is made in Paris.
        
          
        And the best food in Paris, some say,
        is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.
        
          
        Gusteau's restaurant
        is the toast of Paris,
        
          
        booked five months in advance.
        
          
        And his dazzling ascent
        to the top of fine French cuisine
        
          
        has made his competitors envious.
        
          
        He is the youngest chef ever
        to achieve a five-star rating.
        
          
        Chef Gusteau's cookbook,
        Anyone Can Cook!
        
          
        Climbed to the top of the bestseller list.
        
          
        But not everyone
        celebrates its success.
        
          
        Amusing title, Anyone Can Cook!
        
          
        What's even more amusing is that
        Gusteau actually seems to believe it.
        
          
        I, on the other hand,
        take cooking seriously.
